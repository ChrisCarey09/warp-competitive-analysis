## Channel 4: SDR Cadence Framework

### Tier 1: Enterprise Prospects (5+ paid users)
**Cadence: AE-Led, High Touch**

**Touchpoint 1 (Day 1): Phone + Email**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s AI development workflow

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] has several team members using Warp. I'm reaching out because we're seeing engineering teams like yours reduce development cycle time by 40% when they consolidate from multiple AI tools to Warp 2.0's execution-based approach.

I have 15 minutes this week to show you how [Similar Company] eliminated their Cursor + terminal context switching and would love to get your perspective.

Are you free for a brief call Thursday at 2 PM or Friday at 10 AM?

[Calendar Link]

Best,
[AE Name]

P.S. Here's a 2-minute demo of exactly what I mean: [demo link]
```

**Touchpoint 2 (Day 3): LinkedIn Message**
```
Hi [Name], I sent you an email about [Company]'s AI development workflow but wanted to follow up here in case it got lost.

We're seeing teams your size save 8-10 hours per week per developer when they switch from suggestion-based AI to execution-based AI.

Worth a 15-minute conversation about your current setup?
```

**Touchpoint 3 (Day 7): Email with Case Study**
```
Subject: How [Similar Company] reduced deployment time from 2 hours to 20 minutes

Hi [Name],

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief. I mentioned how teams are switching from Cursor/Claude to execution-based AI development.

Here's a detailed case study from [Similar Company Size/Industry] showing exactly how they made the transition: [case study link]

The TL;DR: 40% faster feature delivery, 60% fewer context switches, 90% less copy/paste between AI and terminal.

Still interested in that 15-minute conversation?

[Calendar Link]
```

**Touchpoint 4 (Day 14): Video Message**
```
Subject: Personal demo for [Company] - 2 minutes

Hi [Name],

I recorded a quick personal demo showing how Warp would work specifically for [Company]'s tech stack: [personalized demo link]

This shows the exact workflow your team probably uses daily, but automated end-to-end instead of requiring constant context switching.

Worth discussing?

Quick question: Are other developers at [Company] still using Cursor or Claude for AI assistance?

If so, you might be interested in this comparison showing why teams are consolidating to Warp: [blog post link]

Worth a quick 10-minute call to discuss team expansion options?
